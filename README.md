# Energy-Measurement-Project

Final career project about an energy measurenment system


This manuscript presents an energy-measurement project for a particular home, composed by one or more devices using low cost microcontrollers.

The current Project can be divided into three aspects: first, we have a web application that will monitor the energy consumption, which interacts with the microcontroller and can display the data from it. Next we have a firmware integrated inside the microcontroller used to control the correct function of. Finally, we did a PCB, for better connection and minimize read errors.
Both, control sensors, data and transmission, was made through with Arduino Board, which is based on ATMEGA microcontroller family. We can perform measurement, data storage and data visualization in real time, both on the web or in LCD screen. These data are stored in a mySQL database running in an Apache Web Server.

Regarding the implementation of the Web Application, I used; Html5, Php7.0, JavaScript, Ajax and Bootstrap framework. For graphics on the web, I used graphics library that provides Google, called Google Charts.
Finally, for the PCB layout, I used Fritzing. I opted to use it, because itâ€™s a free program design, which stands out simplicity and speed to design any type of PCB you want.
